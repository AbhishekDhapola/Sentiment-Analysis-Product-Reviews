MICROSOFT WORD ISNT WORKING ON MY LOCAL MAC.
FIRST Data Collection and Preprocessing was done, the model training is in the same file, picked the best model 
app.py is the Flask application which will return the sentiment value(0 for negative and 1 for postive)
I also moved the project to AWS, but for some reason getting an error "can't find app", so I ran a dummy test on my local mac.
Due to AWS,WSGI server,Gunicorn server giving repeated errors I ran a basic Simulation of 5 projects and 40 reviews, assigned randomly to 
each product.
A basic anaylsis of the final Data was done.

Models Folder contains all the various models I trained.
Once Word is running again I will provide a better project report if still required also training BERT aswell, so might add that.
